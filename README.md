# Advanced Stash Helper (Community Edition)
GitHub - State [ alpha ]

# Description
Advanced Stash Helper CE should replicate original ASH when was free, its main porpoise is to bring back the community around it. Feel free to contribute on github.


# DISCLAIMER
To be honest I don't like that ASH got on wrong hands when the software was free now you need to pay. Don't get me wrong, I agree, that everyone who does this things should get pay, but do it yourself, don't monetize other's work.
PS: and also began to work on a C# version of this software. I'm planning to make it a little stable and start sharing as community project in github.
